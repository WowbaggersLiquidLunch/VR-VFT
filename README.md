# VR-VFT


## Overview
Visual Field Tests on VR (SteamVR for now)


## A Few Notes on Collaboration
### for All: 
Please update this **README.md** as soon as possible every time after you push or create a new branch. 

### for Those with Write Access: 
Please check **.gitignore** everytime before you **push** to make sure that everything is right. [This Unity tutorials page](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/production/mastering-unity-project-folder-structure-version-control-systems "Mastering Unity Project Folder Structure - Version Control Systems") provides a good reference. A general rule of thumb: don't commit files with sensitive (personal) information, operating system generated files, or temporary files. 

There is also **.collabignore** for Unity3D's collaboration. Modify it as you need.

### for Those without: 
Please **fork** this project, do whatever you want, and then make a **pull request**.
