# VR-VFT

## A Note on the Current State of Development
In principle, the primary developers (John St. Pierre, Winston La, and 冀卓疌) have ceased all deveopment for this project since 2017-12-8, while the possibility of its further development by other developers is still alive. 

In practice, they did some housekeepings to summarize this 3-month long development, and commited some minor changes to the repository, in preparation of it being handed off to potential new developers.

## Overview
This repository served to coordinate the deveopment of a previously unnamed senior capstone project of the class of 2018, in Lehigh University's IBE program. It was named to reflect the 2 aspects of this project - Virtual Reality and Visual Field Test, before the project finally settled on the name of _Virtual Ocular System_ (VOS), with a slogan "Mobile and immersive vision testing".

The project aimed to develop a prototype for Dr. Avani Shah's idea of testing for visual fields using virtual reality headsets, in pursuit of a mobile and low-cost alternative, for glaucoma screening and diagnosis. Given the developers' crazy schedules at school, it was more than a miracle that they reached their primary goal: a rough proof of concept in a presentable form. Still, it's an understatement to call the code imperfect. It's unpolished, untested, and incomplete. Some unknown parts of the code even broke Unity3D's texture selector. For this reason, the developers send the best of luck to whoever taking over the development.

## Branches 
Here are the descriptions for each branch. 

Name | Description
---------|----------
master | you know what master is
environment | container/environment for the test to take place in
demo | things we want to show off, but not ready for relese yet
spherical-background-shaders | custom shaders for rendering the inside of a sphere instead of the default outside
housekeeping | miscellaneous non-essential stuff, largely unused
